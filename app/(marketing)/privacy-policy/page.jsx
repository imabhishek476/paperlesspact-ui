              </h2>
              <p className="mt-4 opacity-60">
                2.1 While using our Services, we may ask you to provide us with
                certain personally identifiable information (“PII”) that can be
                used to contact or identify you. PII includes, but is not
                limited to, your name, phone number, postal address, email
                address and other information that by itself, or in conjunction
                with other information, can be used to specifically identify
                you. However, PII does not include aggregated information that,
                by itself, does not permit identification.
                <br />
                2.2 Information that we collect when you use our Services
                includes:
                <br />
                (i) Information provided by you When you sign up and register
                with us through the Website and/or App, we ask you for certain
                information. This will includes your name, email address, mobile
                number, telephone number, details of company name &
                registration, company address, and details of legal mandates you
                wish to use our Services for.
                <br />
                Further, we ask you for certain information pertaining to each
                legal mandate that you may wish to list on our Platform. This
                includes information such as your location, gender, other
                details required for the service you may like to buy, which is
                critical for the provision of our Services (“Mandate
                Information”)
                <br />
                (ii) Log Data With the help of third parties like Google and
                Facebook, we collect information that your browser or mobile
                device sends to them whenever you visit our Services ("Log
                Data"). This Log Data includes information such as your
                computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, geolocation and
                geospatial data, browser type and browser version. In case you
                are accessing the App, we may collect certain mobile device
                information such as device ID, model number, operating system,
                global positioning data, application, and other related
                information. We also collect data on the pages of our Services
                that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent
                on those pages, default language and user preferences, and other
                similar usage related statistics. We may assign each user of the
                Services unique identifiers to help keep track of future visits.
                <br />
                (iii) Payment information Our Services require you to make
                payments on the Platform. When you are making any payments, we
                collect billing details from you such as your name, name of
                company, billing address, contact number, payment method and IP
                address, and then redirect you to a secure payment service
                provider platform operated by our payments partner(s) Razorpay,

                <br />
                (iv) Advertising, Use of Cookies, and Other Tracking
                Technologies (Cookie Policy) We advertise in a number of ways,
                including online through managed social media presences, and on
                other unaffiliated sites and mobile applications. To understand
                how our advertising campaigns are performing, we may collect
                certain information via our Sites through our advertising
                service providers. We or our vendors use several common online
                tracking tools to collect information about our users, such as
                browser cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies.
                The information we collect includes IP addresses, the number of
                page visits, pages viewed via our Sites, search engine
                referrals, browsing activities over time and across other
                websites following your visit to one of our Sites or
                applications, and responses to advertisements and promotions on
                the websites and applications where we advertise. We do not
                permit third parties to advertise on our Site.
                <br />
                We also use certain information to:
                <br />
                · Identify new visitors to our Sites;
                <br />
                · Recognize returning visitors;
                <br />
                · Advertise on other websites and mobile applications not
                affiliated with us;
                <br />
                · Analyze the effectiveness of our advertisements;
                <br />
                · Better understand our audience, customers, or other Site
                visitors; and
                <br />
                · Determine whether you might be interested in new products or
                services.
                <br />
                (v) Controlling Our Tracking Tools.
                <br />
                Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How
                you do so, however, depends on your browser and the type of
                cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject all browser
                cookies. If you configure your computer to block all cookies,
                you may disrupt certain web page features, and limit the
                functionality we can provide when you visit or use our Sites. If
                you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we
                have described in this policy will stop. Some browsers have a
                “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do
                not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser
                features are still not uniform, so we are not currently set up
                to respond to those signals.
                <br />
                (vi) Controlling Online Interest-Based Ads.
                <br />
                We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you
                with relevant and useful ads. This may include ads served on
                other companies’ websites. These ads may be based on information
                collected by us or third parties. For example, your geographical
                location may be used to target an ad for people in your area.
                These ads may also be based on your activities on our Sites or
                on third party websites.
                <br />
                (vii)Information received from others
                <br />
                We may combine information about you that we already have with
                information we obtain from other sources, to provide you a
                better end user experience or to improve the quality of our
                Services. Examples of information we may receive from other
                sources includes details of the Mandate Information available to
                us, customer support or enrolment information, page view, search
                term and search result information, and credit or identity
                information which we may use to detect fraud.
                <br />
                Please note that we use google analytics and similar kind of
                tools for the purpose of analytics and measurement of the
                Services. For example, we may use the data gathered from your
                usage of the Services by facebook, twitter etc. to design new
                products or services, or to make our existing offerings under
                the Services more user friendly.
                <br />
                2.3 Apart from the information listed above and the Mandate
                Information made available to us while providing our Services,
                we do not collect any other sensitive information such as
                financial data, political views of any individuals,
                health-related information or sexual orientation of any
                individuals, information related to race, caste or language
                (Collectively, “Sensitive Personal Information”), unless
                required by the provisions of any applicable law.

                have been purchased by a third-party; <br /> (iv) If sharing or

                entities, including any related companies, successors, assigns,

                require that these entities process your PII or other
                information solely as per our instructions and in compliance
                with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
                confidentiality and security measures; <br /> (v) If your PII or
                other information is demanded by a court order or by
                governmental authorities; <br /> (vi) If sharing or disclosure
                of your PII or other information is needed to help prevent

                regulation, ordinance, or treaty; <br /> (vii) If sharing or

                other users; and
                <br /> (viii) If otherwise permitted to do so by this Privacy
                Policy or by provisions of applicable law. <br /> 5.2 The
                following categories of recipients will most likely receive your
                information to enable us to provide the Services to you: <br />{' '}
                (i) Third Party Data Center Services such as Amazon Web Service
                & GCP with its Allied Services/Platform; <br /> (ii) Third Party
                SMTP Services such as gmail.com ; <br /> (iii) Facebook,
                Instagram, for direct marketing;
                <br /> (iv) Third party Service Providers such as Worldline,
                Razorpay etc. <br /> 5.3 All financial information collected on
                the Platform is used solely to enable payments as consideration
                for the Services. No financial information collected on the
                Platform is used for marketing or promotional purposes. Remember
                that if you provide any PII directly to a third party, such as
                through a link on the Website or the App, the processing is
                typically based on their standards (which may not be the same as
                ours); <br />
                5.4 When any PII or other information pertaining to the users is
                shared with third-parties, such as advertisers, licensees and
                content distributors, we shall ensure that such information
                shall be non-private, aggregated or anonymised so that it will
                not identify you personally. You understand that we may further
                distribute your information to a wider audience through
                third-party sites and services, as long such distribution is
                consistent with this clause and other provisions contained in
                this Privacy Policy. <br /> 5.5 We may use external advertising
                companies to serve advertisements when you have visited our
                website. These companies may use anonymised information about
                your visits to this and other websites in order to provide
                advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest
                to you. <br /> 5.6 We may share PII with our parents,
                subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates or as part of any sale,
                merger or acquisition; <br /> 5.7 We will never sell your PII to
                unaffiliated third-parties without your approval at the time of
                collection. You agree to inform us of any changes to your PII,
                and to protect the security of your username, password and PII.

                7.1 The laws of some countries grant particular rights in
                respect of your personal information. If you are a user situated
                in the European Union, you may have the right to:
                <br />
                (i) Request a copy of your information and data portability:
                This right entitles you to know whether we hold any PII about
                you and, if we do, to obtain a copy of such PII in a structured,
                commonly used and machine-readable format;
                <br />
                (ii) Request that your information is deleted: This right
                entitles you to request the deletion of PII, including in
                situations where such PII would no longer be necessary to
                achieve the purposes;
                <br />
                (iii) Request that we correct inaccuracies relating to your
                information: This right entitles you to have PII to be corrected
                if it is inaccurate or incomplete;
                <br />
                (iv) Object to our use of your information: This right entitles
                you to request that we no longer process your PII;
                <br />
                (v) Request that restrictions be placed on processing of PII:
                This right entitles you to request that we only process PII in
                certain circumstances, including with consent.
                <br />
                (vi) You can also request deletion of your account by sending
                email to connect@easedraft.com and we will delete your account.
                <br />
                7.2 If you wish to make a request in respect of your personal
                information, please contact us at info@easedraft.com.
                <br />

                from us, simply follow the unsubscribe options at the bottom of
                each such communication or contact us directly at
                info@easedraft.com. We will make commercially reasonable efforts
                to implement your opt-out requests promptly, but you may still
                receive our emails for up to 7 (seven) working days as we
                process your request.
                <br />
                7.4 In some circumstances, we may not be able to comply with a
                request that you make in respect of your personal information.
                For example, we may not be able to provide a copy of your
                information where it infringes on the rights of another user. We
                may also be required to retain certain information that you ask
                us to delete for various reasons, such as where there is a legal
                requirement to do so.

                8.1 Upon receiving a deactivation request, we will deactivate
                your account and all PII and Sensitive Personal Information
                collected by us will be destroyed. We retain non-personally
                identifiable information indefinitely for the purposes of
                analytics, subject to such information being kept separate from
                other information that may constitute PII or that may, in
                combination with such non-personally identifiable information,
                render the information personally identifiable.
                <br />
                8.2 We collect and retain certain information that is required
                for our detection, investigation and prevention of fraud,
                cheating and other violations of our Terms of Use and applicable
                laws ("Breach(es)"). This data is used only for the purposes of
                detection, investigation, prevention and, where applicable,
                acting on such Breaches and stored only for the minimum amount
                of time needed for the purpose of dealing with such Breaches. If
                the data indicates that such a Breach has occurred, we will
                further store the data for the establishment, exercise or
                defence of legal claims, until a legal case related to it has
                been resolved, or such legal claim no longer exists due to the
                expiry of relevant limitation periods. Please note that the
                specific data stored for dealing with Breaches may not be
                disclosed to you if such disclosure will compromise our legal
                rights as well as the mechanism through which we detect,
                investigate and prevent such Breaches.
